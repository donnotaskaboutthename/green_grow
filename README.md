# Introduction
 In today's world, there are a number of grand challenges that we face as a society, from food scarcity to environmental degradation. To overcome these challenges, we need to improve the scientific and technological environment for all, increasing both the industrial and agricultural bases.
 In agriculture, one of the biggest challenges we face is how to sustainably produce enough food to feed our growing population while minimizing the negative impact on our environment. To address this issue, we present a feedback control system that utilizes the Arduino Uno to optimize plant growth by regulating temperature, humidity, moisture, and light. The agriculture industry faces numerous challenges, including climate change, limited resources, and a growing population. Climate change has led to extreme weather events, which in turn have had negative impacts on crop yields. the climate change has a bad impact on crop by the years increasing the number of events like droughts ,floods, and storms those are harmful to most of the crops. Limited resources, such as water and arable land, make it difficult to produce enough food to feed a growing population.
 To address these challenges, there is a need for innovative solutions that can help increase crop yields while minimizing the negative impact on our environment. One of the earliest feedback control systems used in agriculture was the greenhouse, which was invented in the 19th century. Greenhouses provide a controlled environment for plant growth and protect crops from external environmental factors such as extreme weather events. By regulating temperature, humidity, and light, greenhouse producers can create optimal growing conditions for their crops, regardless of the external climate. Greenhouses have been widely adopted by farmers around the world and have proven to be an effective method of mitigating the negative effects of climate change on agriculture. However, greenhouses can be expensive to build and maintain, making them inaccessible to many farmers. 
To address the challenges faced by the agriculture industry, we set out to design a feedback control system that is sustainable, cost-effective, and easy to implement. Our system needed to have a long lifespan and be able to adapt to different environmental and economic conditions. We also needed to develop a method for mass production, so that our system could be easily replicated on a large scale. Finally, we needed to collect data from our system to track its performance and make any necessary adjustments. To address these requirements, we designed a feedback control system that utilizes the Arduino Uno to regulate temperature, humidity, moisture, and light for optimal plant growth. Our system incorporates a PC fan and an LED that produces heat to regulate the temperature of a confined setting. We used an LDR sensor to govern the amount of light that the plant is exposed to throughout the day, ensuring that it has access to light at all times. The temperature and moisture sensors provide the data required to regulate the input to the system. We also incorporated a small water pump connected to the Arduino to systematize periodic water droplets every five hours. 
Our feedback control system is sustainable and cost-effective, as it utilizes inexpensive and readily available components. The Arduino Uno is affordable and widely available, making it easy to implement, even for those with minimal programming expertise. We also incorporated a method for data collection by using an Excel sheet to track the measurable units from our project.
